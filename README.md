# Image Chopper
This is a desktop GUI for chopping an image via a grid. For example, this program can take a sprite sheet and split each grid cell into its own file.

## What You Need
To run this program, you need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Python Imaging Library (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed. Once you have those, you can run this command in the terminal/command prompt: `python image\ chop.py`
